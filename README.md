### Adding support for new integration components
Catalog components are converted to compliant HTML with the [preact-markup](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md) package.

All component definitions can be found in `src/components/zeit-catalog/index.js`, with their style definitions alongside(src/components/zeit-catalog/style.js)


#### Example component definiton for `<Link/>`
```javascript
export const Link = ({ children, ...props }) => (
	<a class="cmp cmp-link" {...props}>
		{children}
	</a>
);
```

#### Example component style definition for `<Link/>`
```css
.cmp-link {
    color: rgb(6, 125, 247);
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

Built with the [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md)
